(Bundles have a built-in discount of about 10% compared to buying the sticks individually).<br\/><br\/>Having two long sticks and one short stick allows you to utilize the full range of exercises in the training program. There are exercises for two long sticks, single long, and short sticks that allow you to work the entire body efficiently.<br\/><br\/>There are two bundle options to fit different height customers:<br\/><\/p><p><em>If you are under 5’10″ tall get the 6ft + 6ft + 4ft Stick Bundle.<\/em><\/p><p><em>If you are 5’10″ and taller get the 7ft + 7ft + 5ft Stick Bundle.<br\/><br\/><\/em>The short stick is used for ground-based and kneeling exercises, including upper body and hip articulations and stretches, plus some rotational drills and lower body stretches e.g. Dead Bugs, Kayaking, Shin Box 90\/90s, and the Frog Straddle. Short sticks are used when a shorter lever is required, and when drills involve holding both end-grips at once.<br\/><br\/>Two long sticks are used to work both sides of the body at once and create force in different directions (contralateral exercises). These drills involve hanging, twisting, pushing, and pulling in opposing directions to challenge your bilateral coordination, help strengthen and balance the body’s kinetic chain, and can shorten workout time by working both sides of the body at once. <br\/><br\/>Two long sticks also provide added stability. Balance and stability work can be challenging for most people; extra stability allows the body and the central nervous system to learn to adapt to the new stimulus. Using two sticks adds extra support to practice more advanced drills before progressing to single-stick variations, add more stability for older clients, and aid those rehabbing from injuries.<br\/><br\/>HEAVY-DUTY MODEL<br\/>If you are over 250 lbs and exceptionally strong we recommend the Heavy Duty Model sticks. They are thicker and offer considerably more resistance than the standard models.<\/p>"
