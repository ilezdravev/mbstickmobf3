            "title": "Why Are There Two Long Sticks?",
            "answer": "<p>Two long sticks are used to work both sides of the body at once and create force in different directions (contralateral exercises). These drills involve hanging, twisting, pushing, and pulling in opposing directions to challenge your bilateral coordination, help strengthen and balance the body’s kinetic chain, and can shorten workout time by working both sides of the body at once. Two long sticks also provide added stability. Balance and stability work can be challenging for most people; extra stability allows the body and the central nervous system to learn to adapt to the new stimulus. Using two sticks adds extra support to practice more advanced drills before progressing to single-stick variations, add more stability for older clients, and aid those rehabbing from injuries.<\/p>"
