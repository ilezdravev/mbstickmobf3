            "title": "Do I need more than one stick?",
            "answer": "<p>As our training system is based on the use of three sticks (two long sticks, one short), we recommend purchasing a bundle of three sticks to begin your Stick Mobility Training. This allows you to utilize the full range of exercises in the training program as there are specific exercises using two long sticks, single long, and short stick drills that allow you to work the entire body efficiently.If you would like to purchase just one or two sticks to start instead, get the 6-foot sticks if you are under 5’10″ tall, and the 7-foot sticks if you are 5’10” and taller. As a guide, a single long stick allows access to approximately 50% of the exercises, two long sticks cover 75%, and 25% of our exercises are done with a short stick.The short stick is used for ground-based and kneeling exercises, including upper body and hip articulations and stretches, plus some rotational drills and lower body stretches e.g. Dead Bugs, Kayaking, Shin Box 90\/90's, and the Frog Straddle. Short sticks are used when a shorter lever is required, and when drills involve holding both end-grips at once.Two long sticks can be used to work both sides of the body at once and create force in different directions. These drills involve hanging, twisting, pushing, and pulling in opposing directions to challenge your bilateral coordination, help strengthen and balance the body’s kinetic chain, and can shorten workout time by working both sides of the body at once. Two long sticks also provide added stability. Balance and stability work can be challenging; extra stability allows the body and the central nervous system to learn to adapt to the new stimulus. Using two sticks can add extra support to practice more advanced drills before progressing to single-stick variations, add more stability for beginners, older clients, and aid those rehabbing from injuries.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>Stick Mobility can be practiced every day. The benefits of Stick Mobility transfer to performance training and everyday activities. You can use Stick Mobility as a standalone training program or segmentally. It is a system that complements other training systems and sports.Active stretching and flows can be integrated into your daily routine for warm-ups and recovery. Submaximal efforts can be used for pre-exercise activations on a daily basis. Daily active deep stretching will allow you to access increased ranges of motion and help strengthen your body over time.Maximal effort isometrics (90-100%) can be done as a standalone workout, which requires optimal recuperation, as it fully fatigues the central nervous system. (Think of how often you would do maximal lifts in the gym.)Maximal efforts for 1-2 exercises can be introduced per individual workout, but with a limitation of approximately 1-2 minutes of total contraction time. (This is a general guideline for maximal efforts as some people have exceptional capabilities and can handle more load and effort than most.)<\/p>"

Store them flat or vertically in very hot temperatures.Store your Training Sticks either upright or if horizontal support the stick at each end and in the middle to avoid potential bending over time.When flexing the Training Stick, such as in the Bow & Arrow drill, we recommend spinning the stick after each rep so you don’t always bend the stick in the same direction to maintain the stick’s shape over time. One objective with Stick Mobility exercises (e.g. the bow & Arrow drill) is to create tension by flexing the stick.

            "answer": "<p>Sticks can be checked in as luggage on flights but they may incur additional fees. We’ve found that some airlines have special rates or discounts for physical therapy equipment, so we suggest referring to your sticks as such.  We can’t guarantee any discounts due to each airline having its own policies and rates for checked luggage, but it’s worth a try.When you’re traveling domestically it can be more affordable to ship your sticks to your destination via a delivery service such as USPS, UPS, or FedEx. We advise calling and checking with your airline to find out their rates, which you can then compare to shipping costs.Unfortunately, international shipping is not always reliable and rates are often on the high side. If the final destination of the sticks is an international location, checking them as luggage through the airline is the more reliable option, and it is unlikely that shipping them would be more affordable.It is solely the customer’s responsibility to arrange for the transportation of their sticks home from the Certification Courses. If you choose to ship your sticks home, this includes locating the delivery service and purchasing a box to ship them in. We highly recommend pre-planning these details and giving yourself extra time before your flight home to package and drop your sticks off at your chosen postal facility.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>The Stick Mobility Training System has three phases \/ styles of exercises:<br\/><br\/><strong>1. Joint Mobility<\/strong><\/p><p>Joint mobilizations are the foundational key to optimal movement quality. When a joint doesn’t have an ability to move through all three planes of motion well then compensations and\/or the inability to handle internal and external loads can occur which can result in injury. Too often we try to increase the capacity of a joint without discovering if the joint can move appropriately.  Joints need to understand their function before we start increasing their capacity to handle loaded movements and deeper ranges of motion.<br\/><br\/><strong>2. Strength Training<br\/><\/strong>We use isometrics which involves the unweighted resistance of muscle groups through contractions  (tensing) of the muscles. This allows you to safely focus on creating internal tension to increase full-body strength and improve your ability to handle external weighted loads. <br\/><br\/><strong>3. Active Stretching<br\/><\/strong>Our stretches are active rather than traditional passive stretches, so we’re always pulling or pushing on the sticks or the floor to ensure we bring neuromuscular control and stability to your end-range positions.<\/p><p><br\/><strong>Class Examples<\/strong><br\/>In regular 45-minute Stick Mobility classes, you would practice 15 minutes of Joint Mobility exercises, 15 minutes of Strength Training exercises, and 15 minutes of Active Stretching to finish.<\/p>"

            "title": "Why are Stick Mobility exercises more effective than basic stretches?",
            "answer": "<p>Stick Mobility uses the formula: joint range of motion + joint stability + neuromuscular drive = mobility.Traditional, passive stretching by itself lacks these crucial elements.  We know that our muscles get tight for a reason, and no matter how much we stretch, without the right strength levels, they won’t let go. This is typically caused by weakness in one area causing tension in another.For example – tighten the hip flexors, like you do when you sit down all day, and your hamstrings will become overactive when you extend the hip. Tightness makes you more susceptible to injury.The neuromuscular drive benefits from Stick Mobility come as your body is better able to coordinate your muscles as one unified mechanism to produce movement. The better balanced your muscles are, the better they can coordinate your kinetic chain.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p><strong>Leverage<\/strong><\/p><p>The mechanical advantage gained by using a lever such as the Stick Mobility Training Stick allows for a greater range of motion to make it easier to overcome the body’s resistance to bending.<\/p><p><strong>Stability<\/strong><\/p><p>The quality of being stable. The ability to hold a position and resist internal or external forces. The Stick Mobility Training Stick gives you an aid to help create stability in the joints and gives a strong base of support.<\/p><p><strong>Feedback<\/strong><\/p><p>The Stick Mobility Training Stick provides visual and kinesthetic feedback to users and coaches to enhance body awareness and learning. Visual feedback amplifies the movements and targets problem areas. Kinesthetic feedback creates awareness and activation of different muscles, fascial lines, and joint positions and improves spatial awareness.<\/p><p><strong>Irradiation<\/strong><\/p><p>The Stick Mobility Training Stick increases irradiation by driving the sticks into the ground, ceiling, or wall and squeezing to activate grip and trunk power. This allows us to give more input to the nervous system and make changes faster.Sherrington’s Law of Irradiation: “A muscle working hard recruits the neighboring muscles, and if they are already part of the action, it amplifies its strength.  The neural impulses emitted by the contracting muscle reach other muscles and turn them on like an electric current starts a motor.”<\/p><p><strong>Isometrics<\/strong><\/p><p>There are three types of isometric contractions. When you apply all three, you can obtain significant increases in neural drive, muscle fiber recruitment, and rate of production. They include static contraction, yielding contraction, and overcoming contraction.<\/p><p><strong>Coordination<\/strong><\/p><p>The harmonious functioning of the motor apparatus of the brain and particular groups of muscles for the execution of movements. Using the Stick Mobility Training Stick enhances the neural feedback from the hands to the brain. The stick, in conjunction with positional isometrics, can aid in the activation of muscles involved in movements.These scientific principles form the foundation upon which our training system is built.  <\/p><p>The system is accredited by the following organizations:<\/p><p>National Academy of Sports Medicine <\/p><p>Athletics & Fitness Association of America <\/p><p>National College of Exercise Professionals <\/p><p>National Strength & Conditioning Association<\/p><p>Personal Training Academy Global<\/p><p>Alberta Fitness Leadership Certification Association <\/p>"
